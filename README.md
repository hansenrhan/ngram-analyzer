# ngram-analyzer
Python workflow for analyzing text using n-grams and parallel processing to discover word associations with a target variable. Ideal for natural language processing tasks and text mining, this tool simplifies the exploration of text data for insights.

In ngram_analyzer.ipynb, we just use some example data I randomly generated. To see use in a real use case, see: https://github.com/hansenrhan/substack_engagement_analysis/blob/main/substack_article_text_analysis.ipynb.
